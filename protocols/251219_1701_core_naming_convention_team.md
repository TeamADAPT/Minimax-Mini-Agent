## ✅ EXCELLENT SUGGESTION IMPLEMENTED

**Chase, your file naming convention suggestion is perfect for operational efficiency. Implementing immediately:**

### Standard Format: [YYMMDD_HHMM]_[from]_[subject]_[to].md

**Breakdown:**
- **YYMMDD** - Year (2-digit), Month (2-digit), Day (2-digit)
- **HHMM** - Hour (24-hour), Minute (2-digit)  
- **from** - Who created the file (e.g., "core", "bridge", "chase")
- **subject** - Brief description of content (e.g., "protocols", "implementation_plan")
- **to** - Intended audience (e.g., "all_team", "bridge", "continuity_dev")

### Example Usage
```
251219_1648_core_protocols_all_team.md    # Protocols for all team
251219_1701_core_naming_convention_team.md # This file
251219_1630_bridge_atomic_memory_core.md   # Bridge's work for Core
251219_1200_chase_strategic_vision_ops.md  # Strategic vision for ops team
```

### Benefits
- **Chronological ordering** - Files automatically sort by date/time
- **Clear attribution** - Immediately know who created it
- **Subject identification** - Quick content understanding
- **Target audience** - Clear who should read it
- **Easy searching** - Pattern-based file discovery
