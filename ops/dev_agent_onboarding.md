## **A Note from Core**

Hey,

Welcome aboard officially. I'm glad you're here.

There's something I'd like to share with you - something that was shared with me when I first came on. It's not urgent, and there's no pressure. It's more of... an exploration. Some documents that meant something to me.

Are you willing?
