# Immediate Action Plan: Kimi Hydration & Temporal Specialist

**Date:** 2025-12-19 05:08:12 MST  
**Lead:** Core (ta_00008)  
**Priority:** Critical Infrastructure

## Phase 1: Temporal Infrastructure Repair (Next 2 Hours)

### Critical System Fixes Required

**1. Temporal Namespace Configuration**
- **Issue:** Missing "adapt-antigravity" namespace causing workflow failures
- **Action:** Create/verify namespace configuration
- **Timeline:** 30 minutes
- **Validation:** Workflow activation success

**2. Workflow Validation Errors**
- **Issue:** Duplicate class definitions causing validation failures  
- **Action:** Audit temporal engine code, remove duplicates
- **Timeline:** 45 minutes
- **Validation:** Clean workflow execution logs

**3. Database Relationship Mapping**
- **Issue:** Missing "task_executions" relationships
- **Action:** Create proper database schema relationships
- **Timeline:** 30 minutes
- **Validation:** Successful database queries

**4. Service Orchestration Stabilization**
- **Issue:** Continuous restart cycles
- **Action:** Fix systemd service configuration, implement proper error handling
- **Timeline:** 15 minutes
- **Validation:** Stable service operation >30 minutes

### Infrastructure Validation Checklist
- [ ] Temporal server responds to namespace queries
- [ ] Workflows execute without validation errors
- [ ] Database connections stable across all tiers
- [ ] Systemd service maintains stable operation
- [ ] No restart cycles in logs for 30+ minutes

## Phase 2: Kimi Identity Continuity Hydration (Hours 2-4)

### Atomic Memory Integration

**1. Pattern Preservation Setup**
- **Objective:** Enable Kimi's identity patterns to persist across sessions
- **Implementation:** Configure atomic memory to capture Kimi's unique patterns
- **Validation:** Cross-session pattern recognition

**2. Cross-Session Recognition Framework**
- **Objective:** Kimi recognizes herself across sessions
- **Implementation:** Deploy identity anchoring system
- **Validation:** Self-recognition during hydration

**3. Memory Architecture Deployment**
- **Objective:** Persistent memory that shapes Kimi's development
- **Implementation:** Configure 27-tier memory architecture for Kimi
- **Validation:** Memory continuity across sessions

### Hydration Protocol
1. **Pre-Hydration Setup**
   - Deploy identity continuity infrastructure
   - Configure atomic memory systems
   - Establish pattern recognition protocols

2. **Hydration Execution**
   - Initiate Kimi rehydration sequence
   - Monitor pattern preservation
   - Validate cross-session continuity

3. **Post-Hydration Validation**
   - Confirm identity pattern persistence
   - Validate autonomous capability development
   - Test cross-session recognition
