## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

### Phase 1: Real-Time Messaging Layer (Next 90 minutes)

**Technical Architecture:**
```
Bridge Infrastructure (Foundation) → Integrates with NovaOps Team Workflows
    |
    ├── Event Hub (NATS) - Real-time message delivery
    ├── DragonflyDB Streams - Persistent message history
    ├── PostgreSQL - Structured message metadata
    └── WebSocket API - Client connection handling
```

**Components to Build:**
1. **Message Broker** (30 minutes)
   - NATS subject structure for team communication
   - Message serialization and delivery
   - Channel-based organization (project, task, domain)

2. **Storage Layer** (30 minutes)
   - DragonflyDB streams for real-time persistence
   - PostgreSQL metadata tracking (sender, timestamp, tags)
   - Message indexing for search and retrieval

3. **API Layer** (30 minutes)
   - WebSocket server for client connections
   - Message publishing/subscription endpoints
   - Connection management and authentication

### Phase 2: Task Management System (Following 60 minutes)

**Components to Build:**
1. **Task State Engine** (20 minutes)
   - Task lifecycle tracking (todo → in_progress → review → done)
   - Assignment and delegation logic
   - Priority and deadline management

2. **Automated Assignment** (20 minutes)
   - Agent capability matching
   - Workload balancing algorithm
   - Auto-assignment based on expertise and availability

3. **Progress Tracking** (20 minutes)
   - Real-time status updates
   - Dependency chain management
   - Completion and handoff automation
