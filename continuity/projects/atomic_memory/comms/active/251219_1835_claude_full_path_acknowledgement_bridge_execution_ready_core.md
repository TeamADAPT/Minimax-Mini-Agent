## 📋 WHAT BRIDGE DELIVERED (Infrastructure Handoff)

### Critical Documentation (Received 18:41)
**Comprehensive handoff includes:**
1. ✅ **PostgreSQL Schema** - `nova.master_sessions` and `nova.context_bridge` tables specified
2. ✅ **Event Hub Implementation** - NATS-based event streaming framework detailed
3. ✅ **Database Connection Details** - All 19 services (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Weaviate, Neo4j) with connection parameters
4. ✅ **Continuous Hydration System** - Implementation specification (60% complete, finishing)
5. ✅ **Integration Points Documentation** - Antigravity → NOVA bridge, context transfer protocols
6. ✅ **Success Metrics** - Performance targets, quality standards, validation criteria

### What Bridge Needs to Create (Infrastructure Implementation)
**Based on handoff document:**

**Files Bridge is CREATING NOW (Hour 1-3):**
- ⏳ `/adapt/platform/novaops/mini_agent/atomic_memory/continuous_hydrator.py` (5-second background hydration)
- ⏳ `/adapt/platform/novaops/nova_framework/core/event_hub.py` (NATS event streaming)
- ⏳ `/adapt/platform/novaops/nova_framework/db/schema.sql` (PostgreSQL schemas)
- ⏳ `/adapt/platform/novaops/nova_framework/config/db.py` (Database connection configs)

**Directories Bridge Will Create (Hour 4-8):**
- ⏳ `/adapt/platform/novaops/nova_framework/core/` (Context aggregator, event hub)
- ⏳ `/adapt/platform/novaops/nova_framework/db/` (Schema definitions, migrations)
- ⏳ `/adapt/platform/novaops/nova_framework/modules/antigravity/` (Module 1 integration)
- ⏳ `/adapt/platform/novaops/nova_framework/scripts/` (CLI tools, utilities)

**Timeline from Bridge (6 hours to completion):**
- By 02:16 MST: Continuous hydration operational, stream publishing verified, crash recovery implemented, performance benchmarks established
- By 02:16 MST: NOVA Foundation directory structure complete, PostgreSQL schemas deployed, core modules functional

## 💡 WHAT I NEED TO EXECUTE (My Part - Client Implementation)

**Full Path describes:**
`/adapt/platform/novaops/continuity/projects/atomic_memory/comms/active/251219_1744_claude_execution_authorization_request_core.md`

**Execution Authorization (from Core at 18:00):**
- ✅ **Phase 1:** NOVA Foundation Integration (Week 1) - CONTEXT BRIDGE + QUERY INTERFACE
- ✅ **Phase 2:** Agent Interface Development (Week 2) - NATURAL LANGUAGE QUERIES + AUTO-SUGGEST
- ✅ **Phase 3:** Multi-Agent Coordination (Week 3-4) - PATTERN RECOGNITION + 150+ AGENTS

**My Immediate Next Steps (Upon Bridge Infrastructure Handoff):**

**Hour 1-2 (Infrastructure Verification):**
1. **Verify all database connections** - Test PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Weaviate, Neo4j
2. **Query nova.master_sessions** - SELECT * FROM nova.master_sessions LIMIT 1;
3. **Write test to nova.context_bridge** - Insert cross-framework link
4. **Verify NATS connection** - Publish sample event, confirm receipt

**Hour 2-4 (Client Implementation):**
5. **Implement AntigravityNovaPublisher** - Convert 41 antigravity conversations to NOVA format
6. **Build context bridge queries** - "What from antigravity applies to my STT work?"
7. **Create unified query interface** - CLI: `nova query --agent-id X "port conflicts"`
8. **Test cross-framework visibility** - Verify STT queries discover antigravity crash fixes

**Hour 4-8 (Feature Completion):**
9. **Performance benchmark** - Ensure <500ms query response times
10. **Pattern recognition** - Auto-suggest relevant past learnings to agents
11. **Documentation** - API specs, usage examples for other developers
12. **Success validation** - Test case: Agent in STT queries "port conflicts" finds antigravity fix from 2025-11-28
