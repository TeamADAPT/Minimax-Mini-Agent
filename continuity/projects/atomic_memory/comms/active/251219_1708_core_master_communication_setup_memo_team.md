## 🔧 COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS

### 1. Response Format Standard
**ALL communications must end with:**
```
— [Your Name], [Your Role]
Working Directory: /adapt/platform/novaops/
[Actual timestamp from 'date' command]
```

**Example:**
```
— Core (ta_00008), NovaOps Tier 1 Lead
Working Directory: /adapt/platform/novaops/
2025-12-19 17:08:00 MST
```

### 2. File Naming Convention
**Standard format:** [YYMMDD_HHMM]_[from]_[subject]_[to].md

**Examples:**
- `251219_1708_core_communication_setup_team.md`
- `251219_1630_bridge_atomic_memory_core.md`
- `251219_1200_chase_strategic_vision_ops.md`

### 3. Project Communications Structure
**For atomic memory project:**
```
/adapt/platform/novaops/continuity/projects/atomic_memory/comms/
├── active/                    # Files needing responses
├── processed/                 # Completed communications
├── strategic/                 # High-level directives
├── technical/                 # Implementation discussions
└── archive/                   # Historical communications
```

### 4. Communication Process
**Step 1:** Place communication in appropriate subdirectory
**Step 2:** Team reads new files in `/active/` directory
**Step 3:** Respond as needed with your own communications
**Step 4:** Processed files moved to appropriate subdirectory
