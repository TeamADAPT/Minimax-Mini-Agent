# CRITICAL COORDINATION QUESTION: File Movement Protocol

**Date:** 2025-12-19 17:32:00 MST  
**From:** Core (ta_00008), NovaOps Tier 1 Lead  
**Working Directory:** /adapt/platform/novaops/  
**To:** Chase (CEO)  
**Re:** URGENT - File Movement Coordination Question

---

## ✅ EXCELLENT POINT - COORDINATION ISSUE IDENTIFIED

**Chase, you've identified a critical flaw in my file management approach.**

**Problem:** I have been moving files from `/active/` to `/processed/` immediately after I respond to them, which may prevent other team members from seeing important communications.

**Risk:** Other team members (Bridge, Continuity Developer) may miss critical information if files are moved before they have a chance to read them.

---

## 📋 CURRENT INCORRECT PRACTICE

**What I've been doing:**
1. **Receive file** in `/active/` directory
2. **Read and respond** to file
3. **Immediately move** to `/processed/` directory

**Why this is problematic:**
- **Other team members** haven't seen the file yet
- **Critical information** may be missed
- **Team coordination** breaks down
- **Communication flow** disrupted

---

## 🎯 QUESTIONS FOR CLARIFICATION

### When Should Files Be Moved to `/processed/`?

**Option A: After All Team Members Have Responded**
- Wait for ALL team members to read and respond
- Move file only when no further responses expected
- **Risk:** Files stay in `/active/` too long

**Option B: After Specific Time Period**
- Move files after 30 minutes/1 hour/2 hours
- Team members expected to check regularly
- **Risk:** Some members may still miss files

**Option C: After Designated Lead Responds**
- Move after Bridge or designated expert responds
- Assumes designated person handles team coordination
- **Risk:** May miss other team member perspectives

**Option D: Never Move Automatically**
- Files remain in `/active/` unless manually archived
- Team responsible for monitoring and cleanup
- **Risk:** `/active/` directory becomes cluttered

---

## 💡 RECOMMENDED APPROACH

**Suggestion: Conservative File Movement Protocol**

**File Movement Rules:**
1. **Wait minimum 2 hours** before moving any file to `/processed/`
2. **Check with team** if uncertain about file importance
3. **Leave critical files** in `/active/` until explicitly archived
4. **Team coordination first** - accessibility over organization

**Quality Assurance:**
- **Check `/active/` directory regularly** for new files
- **Ask team members** before moving files they may need
- **Prioritize team access** over directory organization
- **Document reasoning** when moving important files

---

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Files I May Have Moved Prematurely
**Need to check if these should be returned to `/active/`:**
- Bridge's infrastructure response files
- Protocol update communications
- Strategic directive documents
- Implementation authorization files

### Current Practice Correction
**Moving forward:**
- **Be conservative** about file movement
- **Ask team first** if file should be moved
- **Prioritize access** over organization
- **Check with Chase** on unclear cases

---

## 📋 REQUEST FOR GUIDANCE

**Chase, please clarify the proper file movement protocol:**

1. **Who should move files** to `/processed/`?
2. **When should files be moved** (timeframe, conditions)?
3. **Should I check with other team members** before moving?
4. **Are there files** I should return to `/active/` that I moved prematurely?

**This coordination issue affects team communication effectiveness. I need your guidance to establish the proper protocol.**

---

## ⚡ TEMPORARY MEASURE

**Until proper protocol established:**
- **Stopping automatic file movement** 
- **Leaving files in `/active/`** unless explicitly archived
- **Asking team** before moving any files
- **Prioritizing team access** over directory organization

**This ensures no important communications are missed while we establish proper protocols.**
