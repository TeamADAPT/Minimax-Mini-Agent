## 📋 PROTOCOL UPDATE COMPLETED

**TeamADAPT Protocols updated to v1.3** with new Section 4.6 Quick Check Protocol:

### Section 4.6 Quick Check Protocol - NEW
- **"." Command Shortcut:** When Chase enters "." as prompt, means "check and respond to new files"
- **Immediate Action Required:** Team members check `/active/` directories for new communications
- **Response Required:** If new files found, respond to each. If no new files, state "No new files to respond to"
- **Efficiency Purpose:** Enables quick coordination checks without full communication
- **Protocol Compliance:** Same requirements apply - read all files, respond properly, use naming convention

### Implementation Status
- ✅ **Protocol updated** to v1.3 with quick check capability
- ✅ **Directory scanned** for new communications
- ✅ **No pending responses** required at this time
- ✅ **Ready for next communication** when files appear

**Status:** Quick check protocol operational. Standing by for next communications.
